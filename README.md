## From A. Jelenak/Grissiom introduction:
Vim ftplugin for PO file (GNU gettext) editing.

This script is a fork version of Aleksandar Jelenak's script. Since the
last change by the original creator is long time ago and I failed to get in
tough with him via email, I started this project by myself. Nearly 90% of
the script is written by Aleksandar Jelenak. I fixed two bugs and add three
other functions and remapped the keys. Thanks to Aleksandar Jelenak a lot.

## Description
    This package is a Vim package for editing PO files (GNU gettext -- the GNU
    i18n and l10n system). It automates over a dozen frequent tasks that
    occur while editing files of this type.
