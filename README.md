Vim ftplugin for PO file (GNU gettext) editing.
This script is a fork version of Aleksandar Jelenak's script. Since the 
last change by the original creator is long time ago and I failed to get in
tough with him via email, I started this project by myself. Nearly 90% of
the script is written by Aleksandar Jelenak. I fixed two bugs and add three
other functions and remapped the keys. Thanks to Aleksandar Jelenak a lot.
