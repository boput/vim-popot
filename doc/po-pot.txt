3. Other Functionalities									*po-pot.func*

Information about the translator and language team is supplied by two
global variables: 'g:po-pot.translator' and 'g:po_lang_team'.  They should be
defined in the ".vimrc" (UNIX) or "_vimrc" (Windows) file.  If they are not
defined, the default values (descriptive strings) are put instead.

Vim's "gf" Normal mode command is remapped (local to the PO buffer, of
course).  It will only function on lines starting with "#: ".  Search
for the file is performed in the directories specified by the 'path'
option.  The user can supply its own addition to this option via the
'g:po_path' global variable.  Its default value for PO files can be
found by typing ":set path?" from within a PO buffer.  For the correct
format please see ":help 'path'".  Warning messages are printed if no
or more than one file is found.

Vim's Quickfix mode (see ":help quickfix") is used for browsing
through msgfmt-reported errors for the file.  No MO file is created
when running the msgfmt program since its output is directed to
"/dev/null".  The user can supply command-line arguments to the msgfmt
program via the global variable 'g:po_msgfmt_args'.  All arguments are
allowed except the "-o" for output file.  The default value is
"-vv -c".

Format the whole file is actually using msgmerge a.po a.po -o a.po.
Since we must reload the file that has been modified, you could not
do any Undo once you run this function.

But there's even more!

Every time the PO file is saved, a PO-formatted time stamp is
automatically added to the file header.  Note that if the file is marked
'fuzzy', i.e, there is a "#, fuzzy" in the head of the file, the time
stamp will not be updated.
